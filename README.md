# Vulnerability_Scanner
Developed a Python-based vulnerability scanner that detects open ports and identifies vulnerable services by comparing service banners with known vulnerability lists. Utilized a custom-built port scanner to scan a user-specified number of ports and implemented logic to match banners with vulnerabilities from an external file. Successfully tested the scanner in a virtualized environment (Kali Linux and Metasploitable), identifying multiple vulnerable services. The project enhances network security by automating the discovery of vulnerable ports and services.
